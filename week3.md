# Making Data Management Decisions

## Preview
In this assignment you will find three data managed variables, provided from NESARC codebook, as frequency distributions. For the variable **‘AGE’**, I decided to split the ages of the observations in four categories (18-21, 21-24, 24-27, 27-30), in order to examine the age frequency distribution of the sample into quartiles. Furthermore, I included missing data in the cannabis use variable distribution for ages 18 to 30, with the row ‘Unknown’ set to ‘nan’. In addition, after recoding variable **‘S3BD5Q2E’**, which represents average rate of cannabis use, I created a new variable called **‘CUFREQMO’** that indicates how many days an individual used cannabis per month, when using the most. Moreover, once I ran frequency distribution for the variable **‘CUFREQMO’** and calculated the counts and the percentages of this use per month, I created a secondary variable with the name **‘NUMJOPMOTH_EST’**. This variable estimates the quantity of cannabis joints smoked per month for the first 30 participants (18-30) when using the most, by multiplying the amount of joints smoked per day (variable **‘S3BQ4’**) with the variable **‘CUFREQMO’**, which indicates the number of days an individual smoked per month. I finished with the creation of one more variable called **‘NUMMDGENANX’** that stands for the total number of participants who were diagnosed with either major depression, general anxiety or both illnesses. After examining the frequency distribution of this variable, I used the define function to create one last variable with the name **‘DEPRESSIONANXIETY’**, which characterizes the mental state of the first 30 random cannabis users aged 18 to 30, as far as these two disorders are concerned. For the code and the output i used Spyder (IDE).

## Output

Firstly, a new variable called **‘AGE4GROUPS’** was necessary to be created in order to divide participants, aged between 18 and 30 years old, into four age groups: 18-21, 21-24, 24-27 and 27-30. From the frequency distribution it can be noticed that about 30.73% were between 18 and 21 years old, 23.78% were between 21 and 24, 20.65% fell into 24-27 group and 24.82% fell into 27-30 group.

For the frequency distribution of variable **‘S3BQ1A5′** the missing data is included and option 9 is set to ‘NaN’, which represents the choice ‘Unknown’. As we can see the number of the missing data is 81 individuals and the proportion is 0.84% which is significantly small. Regarding the new variable with the name **’CUFREQMO’**  which I created, the distribution results show that about 15.96% smoked cannabis less than once per year, whereas approximately 22.13% used to smoke cannabis in an everyday basis. The rest of the cannabis use rates vary from about 2.65% for less than once per month, to 11.6% for an average use of 6 times per month.

Taking into account the new variable **‘NUMJOPMOTH_EST’** which I created, the output illustrates the estimation of the quantity of joints smoked by young adults aged 18 to 30 per month, by multiplying the quantity of joints smoked per day with the total number of days that they used cannabis per month. By examining the first 30 observations of the sample, it is noticeable that the majority of individuals smoked approximately less than 10 joints per month. On the other hand there were also some participants who were smoking more than 100 joints monthly, since individuals with ID numbers 511 and 506 for example, peaked at 180 and 150 joints per month respectively.

As far as the new secondary variable **‘NUMMDGENANX’** is concerned, it is obvious that around 77% of cannabis users aged between 18 and 30 were mentally healthy in the last 12 months, after using marijuana for more than 1 year, while a percentage of 21.07% were diagnosed with either major depression or general anxiety. Only 1.91% of them were diagnosed with both mental disorders mentioned above. Finally, regarding the first 30 observations table, presented in the end, the define function used, returns 0 if an individual had no problem with either depression or anxiety in the last 12 months, 1 if an individual met the criteria for both disorders, 2 if an individual was diagnosed only with major depression and 3 if an individual was diagnosed only with general anxiety. For the results, a new variable named **‘DEPRESSIONANXIETY’** was created.
